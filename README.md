# STL Amandi Foundation
The STL-Amandi Foundation (SAF) is a Ghanaian registered non-profit organization that has been set up by the STL Group and its dedicated employees to support and promote the education, health and welfare of the children in our communities. One of STL Group's core business areas is in construction (Amandi) and we use our knowledge and assets to help reconstruct schools and medical centers for the towns and villages in which we work.
